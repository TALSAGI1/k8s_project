This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Kubernetes concepts using a simple Python web application. The goal is to provide a complete and practical example of the application lifecycle, from building a Docker image to deploying and managing resources within a Kubernetes cluster.

Core Project Components ðŸ§©
The project is built upon several key Kubernetes objects, each serving a critical role in the application's deployment:

Dockerfile: This file contains all the necessary instructions to build the Docker image for the Python application. It defines the runtime environment, dependencies, and the main command to run the application.

Python Application (Flask): A lightweight web application configured to consume data from a ConfigMap and a Secret via environment variables. The app also includes essential liveness (/healthz) and readiness (/ready) probes for Kubernetes to monitor its health.

Kubernetes YAML: A single YAML file that defines the entire deployment configuration:

Namespace: A dedicated namespace called dev-project to isolate all project resources from the rest of the cluster.

ConfigMap & Secret: Objects used to decouple configuration data and sensitive information from the application's code, ensuring flexibility and security.

Deployment: Manages the application's deployment by creating and maintaining a desired number of Pod replicas.

Service: Exposes the application using a stable internal IP address and a NodePort, allowing for external access to the application.
